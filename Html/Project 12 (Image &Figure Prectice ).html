        Hacking refers to the act of gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data. Hackers often exploit vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or human behavior to break into systems. 
        While the term "hacking" is often associated with illegal activity, there are also ethical hackers (known as "white hats") who help organizations find and fix security weaknesses before malicious hackers (called "black hats") can exploit them.

        There are many types of hacking techniques, such as phishing, malware attacks, brute force attacks, and social engineering. 
        Some hackers aim for financial gain, stealing credit card numbers or sensitive personal information, while others may hack for political reasons, activism, or simply the challenge. 
        As technology continues to evolve, so do the methods used by hackers, making cybersecurity an increasingly critical field.
